# Basic Compiler Implementation

This project is a simple compiler that processes mathematical expressions, parses them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then evaluates or generates Python code from the AST. Below is the breakdown of each step involved in creating this compiler.

---

## Step 1: Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)

### Purpose:

The first stage of any compiler is **lexical analysis**, which is responsible for **tokenizing** the raw input code. This means breaking down the source code into smaller, manageable pieces (tokens) that represent the smallest meaningful units in the code.

### Why It’s Done:

- **Tokenization** simplifies the parsing process. By converting the source code into tokens, the syntax analysis (parsing) stage doesn’t need to worry about the intricacies of raw code.
- Tokens are categorized into different types, such as numbers, operators, keywords, identifiers (variable names), and delimiters.

### What Happens:

- The input code is scanned character by character, and regular expressions (regex) are used to match patterns corresponding to different token types (e.g., numbers, operators, assignment operators).
- If any character in the input does not match a recognized pattern, it is flagged as an error.

### Benefits:

- Enables the parser to focus on the structure of the code (syntax) rather than dealing with raw characters.

---

## Step 2: Syntax Analysis (Parsing)

### Purpose:

**Syntax analysis**, or **parsing**, is responsible for analyzing the structure of the token sequence produced by the lexical analysis. It checks whether the tokens follow the grammar rules of the language and organizes them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

### Why It’s Done:

- The purpose of parsing is to determine whether the input code is syntactically correct (i.e., follows the language rules).
- The **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** is a hierarchical representation of the program that abstracts away syntactic details but retains the essential structure needed for further analysis or execution.

### What Happens:

- The parser uses a set of grammar rules (a formal description of the language’s syntax) to combine tokens into larger structures.
- For example, in arithmetic expressions, the parser would combine tokens like numbers and operators into a **binary operation**.
- The result is an AST, where each node represents a syntactic construct (such as an expression or a statement).

### Benefits:

- It ensures the program adheres to the correct syntax.
- The AST is a foundation for code evaluation or further compilation steps, like generating executable code.

---

## Step 3: Evaluation

### Purpose:

Once the AST is constructed, the next step is **evaluation**. This step involves **executing** the code represented by the AST and obtaining the result of expressions or assignments.

### Why It’s Done:

- Evaluation allows the compiler to process and compute the result of the program. For example, given the expression `x = 10 + 20`, the evaluator computes `10 + 20 = 30` and stores it in the variable `x`.

### What Happens:

- The evaluator recursively traverses the AST, and depending on the type of node (number, binary operator, or assignment), it computes the corresponding result.
- For operations like addition or subtraction, the evaluator combines values from the left and right subtrees (children of the operation node) to perform the computation.

### Benefits:

- This is the step where actual computation happens, and it allows the interpreter or compiler to provide output based on the code’s logic.
- It enables dynamic execution of expressions.

---

## Step 4: Code Generation

### Purpose:

After parsing and evaluation, we can take the final step, which is **code generation**. The goal is to generate code in a target language (in this case, Python) based on the AST.

### Why It’s Done:

- Code generation allows you to produce executable code from the AST.
- In this case, we are converting the parsed program into Python code, which can be executed directly or further processed.

### What Happens:

- The AST is traversed, and for each type of node (such as assignment or binary operation), we generate the corresponding code in Python syntax.
- For example, an assignment node might generate the Python code `x = 10 + 20`, while a binary operation node would generate the code to perform the operation (e.g., `10 + 20`).

### Benefits:

- It makes the program portable since you can now generate code in a high-level language.
- It also serves as a foundation for further stages like optimizations, compiling to machine code, or running the generated Python code.

## Step 5: Additional Features (Future Work)

### Purpose:

The steps outlined above cover the basic functionality of a compiler. However, real-world compilers usually include more complex features, such as:

### 1. Parentheses Support

- **Why:** Parentheses allow you to control the order of operations in expressions. Handling them correctly is essential for evaluating expressions properly.

### 2. Handling Different Data Types

- **Why:** Real-world programs work with various data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Expanding the compiler to handle these will make it more robust.

### 3. Control Flow (If-Else)

- **Why:** Most programs require decision-making logic, like conditional statements (`if-else`). The compiler will need to support this feature for practical usage.

### 4. Error Handling

- **Why:** Error handling is crucial in any compiler to report issues like syntax errors, type errors, or runtime errors. It ensures the program doesn’t crash and gives meaningful feedback to the user.

### 5. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

- **Why:** A REPL allows interactive execution of code, which is useful for debugging and learning purposes. It would let the user write expressions and immediately see results.

### 6. Generating More Complex Code

- **Why:** Beyond generating simple Python code, you might want to extend the compiler to generate more complex programs or even machine code.

---

## Running the REPL

Once we have a working compiler, we could implement a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to allow interactive coding. In a REPL:

- The user types an expression.
- The compiler tokenizes, parses, evaluates, and prints the result.
- This loop continues, allowing for iterative testing and debugging.

---

## Future Steps

### Optimization

- Further optimization of both the tokenizer and parser could improve performance, especially for larger programs.

### Extending Features

- Adding support for loops (`for`, `while`), function definitions, and other advanced features can make the compiler more powerful and versatile.

### Code Generation to Other Languages

- Expanding the code generation phase to target multiple programming languages (like C, JavaScript) will enhance the compiler’s applicability.

This project sets the foundation for building more advanced compilers in the future. As you expand it, keep in mind the key phases of compilation: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
